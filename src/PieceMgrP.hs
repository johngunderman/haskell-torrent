-- | The Piece Database tracks the current state of the Torrent with respect to pieces.
--   In the database, we book-keep what pieces are missing, what are done and what are
--   currently in the process of being downloaded. The crucial moment is when we think
--   we have a full piece: we check it against its SHA1 and if it is good, we can mark
--   that piece as done.
--
--   Better implementations for selecting among the pending Pieces is probably crucial
--   to an effective client, but we keep it simple for now.

    , inProgress    :: M.Map PieceNum InProgressPiece -- ^ Pieces in progress
    , infoMap       :: PieceMap   -- ^ Information about pieces
    }

-- | The InProgressPiece data type describes pieces in progress of being downloaded.
--   we keep track of blocks which are pending as well as blocks which are done. We
--   also keep track of a count of the blocks. When a block is done, we cons it unto
--   @ipHaveBlocks@. When @ipHave == ipDone@, we check the piece for correctness. The
--   field @ipHaveBlocks@ could in principle be omitted, but for now it is kept since
--   we can use it for asserting implementation correctness. We note that both the
--   check operations are then O(1) and probably fairly fast.
